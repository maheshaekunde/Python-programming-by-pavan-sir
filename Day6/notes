# functions
---------------
A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called.

You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function.

A function can return data as a result.


#Creating a Function:
In Python a function is defined using the def keyword

#Calling a Function:
To call a function, use the function name followed by parenthesis


# Global and Local variables:
Python Global variables are those which are not defined inside any function and have a global scope whereas
Python local variables are those which are defined inside a function and their scope is limited to that function only.
In other words, we can say that local variables are accessible only inside the function in which
it was initialized whereas the global variables are accessible throughout the program and inside every function.


# two types of arguments/parameter we can pass to the function.
1. Positional argument.
2. Keyword argument.
The terms parameter and argument can be used for the same thing: information that are passed into a function.

From a function's perspective:
A parameter is the variable listed inside the parentheses in the function definition.
An argument is the value that are sent to the function when it is called
